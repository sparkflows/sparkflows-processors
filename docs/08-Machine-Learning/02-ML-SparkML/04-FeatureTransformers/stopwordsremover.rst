 Stop Words Remover Node Details
+++++++++++++++

Stop words are words which should be excluded from the input, typically because the words appear frequently and donâ€™t carry as much meaning.

The Stop Words Remover node takes as input a sequence of strings (e.g. the output of a Tokenizer) and drops all the stop words from the input sequences. 

Input Parameters
```````````````

*  OUTPUT STORAGE LEVEL : Keep this as DEFAULT.
*  INPUT COLUMN : Select the array column type from where we will remove the stop words.
*  OUTPUT COLUMN : The name of the output column.
*  CASE SENSITIVE : Specifies Whether to do a case sensitive comparison over the stop words. (Default = False)
*  COMMA SEPARATED LIST OF CUSTOM STOP WORDS : Optional, specify comma separated stop words. Note that the default stopwords original list can be found from "Glasgow Information Retrieval Group" http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words

 Stop Words Remover Node Example
+++++++++++++++

Assume that we have the following DataFrame with columns id and raw:

 id | raw
----|----------
 0  | [I, saw, the, red, balloon]
 1  | [Mary, had, a, little, lamb]
 
Applying the <b>StopWordsRemover</b> node with <b>raw</b> as the input column and <b>filtered</b> as the output column, we should get the following:

 id | raw                         | filtered
----|-----------------------------|--------------------
 0  | [I, saw, the, red, balloon]  |  [saw, red, balloon]
 1  | [Mary, had, a, little, lamb]|[Mary, little, lamb]

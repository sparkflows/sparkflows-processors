AFT Survival Regression
=========== 

Accelerated failure time (AFT) model which is a parametric survival regression model for censored data.

Output
--------------
It generates the LAFTSurvivalRegressionModel and passes it to the next Predict and ModelSave Nodes. The input DataFrame is also passed along to the next nodes.

Details

Apache Spark ML implements the Accelerated failure time (AFT) model which is a parametric survival regression model for censored data. It describes a model for the log of survival time, so itâ€™s often called a log-linear model for survival analysis. Different from a Proportional hazards model designed for the same purpose, the AFT model is easier to parallelize because each instance contributes to the objective function independently.

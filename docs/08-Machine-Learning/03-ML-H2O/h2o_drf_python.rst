        - Whether to keep cross-validation assignments.
      * - distribution

        - Distribution function used by algorithms that support it; other algorithms use their defaults.
      * - weightCol
        - Weight Column
        - Column with observation weights. Giving some observation a weight of zero is equivalent to excluding it from the dataset; giving an observation a relative weight of 2 is equivalent to repeating that row twice. Negative weights are not allowed. Note: Weights are per-row observation weights and do not increase the size of the data frame. This is typically the number of times a row is repeated, but non-integer values are supported as well. During training, rows with higher weights matter more, due to the larger loss function pre-factor. If you set weight = 0 for a row, the returned prediction frame at that row is zero and this is incorrect. To get an accurate prediction, remove all rows with weight == 0.

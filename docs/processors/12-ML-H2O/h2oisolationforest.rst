Details
-------


Isolation Forest is similar in principle to Random Forest and is built on the basis of decision trees. Isolation Forest, however, identifies anomalies or outliers rather than profiling normal data points. Isolation Forest isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of that selected feature. This split depends on how long it takes to separate the points.

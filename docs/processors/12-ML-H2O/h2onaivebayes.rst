Details
-------


Naïve Bayes is a classification algorithm that relies on strong assumptions of the independence of covariates in applying Bayes Theorem. The Naïve Bayes classifier assumes independence between predictor variables conditional on the response, and a Gaussian distribution of numeric predictors with mean and standard deviation computed from the training dataset.

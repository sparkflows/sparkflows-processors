Logistic Regression
=========== 

Logistic regression. Currently, this class only supports binary classification.

Input
--------------
This takes in a DataFrame and performs Logistic Regression

Output
--------------
The Logistic Regression Model generated is passed along to the next nodes. The input DataFrame is also passed along to the next nodes

Details
-------


Logistic regression is a popular method to predict a categorical response. 

It is a special case of Generalized Linear models that predicts the probability of the outcomes. 
In spark.ml logistic regression can be used to predict a binary outcome by using binomial logistic regression, or it can be used to predict a multiclass outcome by using multinomial logistic regression.

Examples
-------


The below example is available at : https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/ml-classification-regression.html#logistic-regression
+++++++++++++++


import org.apache.spark.ml.classification.LogisticRegression

// Load training data
val training = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/mllib/sample_libsvm_data.txt")

val lr = new LogisticRegression()
  .setMaxIter(10)
  .setRegParam(0.3)
  .setElasticNetParam(0.8)

// Fit the model
val lrModel = lr.fit(training)

// Print the coefficients and intercept for logistic regression
println(s"Coefficients: ${lrModel.coefficients} Intercept: ${lrModel.intercept}")

// We can also use the multinomial family for binary classification
val mlr = new LogisticRegression()
  .setMaxIter(10)
  .setRegParam(0.3)
  .setElasticNetParam(0.8)
  .setFamily("multinomial")

val mlrModel = mlr.fit(training)

// Print the coefficients and intercepts for logistic regression with multinomial family
println(s"Multinomial coefficients: ${mlrModel.coefficientMatrix}")
println(s"Multinomial intercepts: ${mlrModel.interceptVector}")

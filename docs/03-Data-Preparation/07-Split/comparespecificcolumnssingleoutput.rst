Details
-------


This node takes two Dataframe as input, compares them on specific columns and creates one outgoing Dataframes as output 
based on the Compare Type selected to compare two incoming Dataframes.

If Compare Type is selected as LEFTDATAFRAME_EXCEPT_RIGHTDATAFRAME then outgoing Dataframe is created based on (A-B) and it consists of rows of 1st Dataframe 
in which values in the specified columns don't have matching entries in same set of columns in 2nd Dataframe.

If Compare Type is selected as RIGHTDATAFRAME_EXCEPT_LEFTDATAFRAME then outgoing Dataframe is created based on (B-A) and it consists of rows of 2nd Dataframe 
in which values in the specified columns don't have matching entries in same set of columns in 1st Dataframe.

If Compare Type is selected as LEFTDATAFRAME_INTERSECT_RIGHTDATAFRAME then outgoing Dataframe is created based on (A intersection B) and it consists of rows 
common in both incoming Dataframes in which values in the specified columns have matching entries in same set of columns.
